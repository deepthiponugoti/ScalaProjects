What is normal order? Give a working example to illustrate this in a language of your choice.
Discuss here, but put the code in a separate file with proper extension. Ensure the code works.

In Normal order the operators and parameters are evaluated only after the procedure is fully evaluated. For example for square(2+3), in normal order, it is evaluated as (2+3)*(2+3) = 5*5 = 25. It produces the same result as applicative order, but not as efficient as applicative order. 
However some times the lazy evaluation is more beneficial as it eliminates the need for computations and push it for later evaluations.
