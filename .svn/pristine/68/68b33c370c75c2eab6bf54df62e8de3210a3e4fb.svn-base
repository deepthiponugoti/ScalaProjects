This code is not in any specific language; it's a pseudo-code.

values = [1, 2, 3]
factor = 4
values.foreach { e -> print(e * factor) }
factor = 7

Is the lambda expression / closure passed to foreach a pure function?
Explain, giving reason for your observation.

A pure function has two main features.
 a) function always gives out the same result for same arguments,
 b) should not cause any side effects, i.e, it should not change any mutable objects which are passed to it.
 
 The lambda expression / closure passed to foreach here does not have any side effects as it is not changing any mutable objects.
 But, it depends on the outside parameter 'factor' so, the output of the function varies depending on the 'factor' value for the same input list. 
 So, it is not a pure function.
