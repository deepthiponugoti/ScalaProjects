Statement: "A statically typed language is one in which the programmer has to specify 
the full type details for every variable at compile time."

What's your view of that statementâ€”discuss, and provide examples to support your discussion.

No, we do not agree on this statement. In statically typed languages like Java, we specify the full type information as follows:

int value = 1;

Otherwise, the compiler will throw the errors at compile time.

However, this does not mean we need to specify full type information for every variable at compile time for every other statically typed language.

Scala, being statically typed language does not insist on the type information and it automatically infers the type for us. 

Scala: 
def factorial(number : Int) : Int = {
    var fact = 1
	(1 to number).foreach { e => fact *= e }
	fact
}
println(factorial(5))

In the above example, we can see that we did not specify any type information for variable "fact". Scala infered it automatically.
