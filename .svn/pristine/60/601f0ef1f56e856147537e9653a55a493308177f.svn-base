What is applicative order? Give a working example to illustrate this in a language of your choice.
Discuss here, but put the code in a separate file with proper extension. Ensure the code works..

If the operators and parameters are evaluated before procedure is evaluated then it is called applicative order. For example if square(2+3), in applicative order, 2+3 is evaluated first and then square(5) is executed as 5*5.
This is efficient, also removes duplicate computations. Here in the example instead of computing 2+3 two times, it reduced the number of addition computations by computing it first.

In the example attached, Java is call by value and it comes under strict evaluation and is equivalent to applicative order taught in the class.  listOfNumbers.add(listOfNumbers.get(listOfNumbers.size() - 1) + listOfNumbers.get(listOfNumbers.size() - 2)); line in the fibonacci series function is executed in the applicative order. The + operation is evaluated first and then the added number is passed on to add function.
