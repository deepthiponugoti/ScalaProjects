Refactor and then move to the next language.

review: rework the syntax

dsl.txt: Too noisy with double quoted strings everywhere.
We want to create a syntax the language will readily accept (syntax
that is part of the language) and is fluent at the same time.

We don't want to be reading files and parsing files. All we want is
to exploit the fluency afforded by the language, push it to limits
to make the code look less like code in the syntax we use.

review: revisit the syntax

Looking at the dsl.txt, new is a smell, create would be so much better. Also,
would Scala support the syntax given in the file or do we have to make some changes
to the syntax to make it compatible with Scala?

Once you decide on the syntax, start with the first test to process a pice of
code like the first line alone. Then incrementally we can get to the following
lines in the modified syntax.

review: let's get a grasp of fluency first

We see new in the setup. Do we want to be using new?
Jot down a sample DSL first in a file. Let's examine that and see if it
is fluent enough and, at the same time, feasible to implement in the language.

Once we have an idea what to create, we can then test drive it.
