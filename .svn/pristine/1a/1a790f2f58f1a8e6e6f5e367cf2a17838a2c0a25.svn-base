Is there any difference between typing in Java/C# vs. typing in C/C++?
Discuss.


Statically typed language is which requires compile-time enforcement of a type system. Dynamically typed language is the language which provides information about types at runtime, and may permit operations based on that information.

C++ and Java have static type checking by definition. Comparatively C++'s static typing system is much stronger, especially with respect to templates. C++ provides  some runtime facilities for typing as well, such as Run Time Type Information, which allows the type of an object to be determined during program execution, but these features are provided by library on demand by the users, while java does not provide it. C++ follows the philosophy that if you can perform the necessary determinations statically (i.e. at compile time), you're better off doing that than paying the runtime cost of determining them dynamically. By contrast,in Java you pretty much agree up front to pay the cost for dynamic typing, so it finds its way into standard Java idioms pretty extensively.  It's handy to have this available in Java, because of the diminished static typing as compared to C++.
